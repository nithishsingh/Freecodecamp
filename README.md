# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project visualizes time series data of freeCodeCamp.org forum page views from May 9, 2016, to December 3, 2019, using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to identify visit patterns, analyze yearly/monthly growth, and create three types of visualizations:

- **Line Chart**: Depicts daily page views.
- **Bar Chart**: Shows average daily page views per month grouped by year.
- **Box Plots**: Illustrate data distribution within a year/month and its trend over time.

The project involves data processing, cleaning, and creating functions for generating the visualizations. Included files facilitate development, testing, and execution of the visualization functions.
